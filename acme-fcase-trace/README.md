This log is from an F-case simulation of the ACME framework (now E3SM) on the Cetus system at ALCF (now decomissioned). It is notable in that it contains DXT data for a large-scale application run. The I/O workload is unique in that ACME uses I/O delegate processes, leaving many ranks idle in terms of read/write activity.
