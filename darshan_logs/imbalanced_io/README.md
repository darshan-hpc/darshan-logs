This example is an anonymized Darshan log that represents a heavily imbalanced I/O workload. In particular, one can observe a balanced I/O workload to file record 15708535418621378501 at the MPI-IO layer, but at the POSIX layer there is a clear imbalance (see SLOWEST_RANK_BYTES and FASTEST_RANK_BYTES counters). The Lustre module stripe info makes clear this issue is due to this file being striped across only a single file server -- in this case MPI-IO picks a single writer process for POSIX I/O, leading to a large imbalance.
