This directory contains Darshan logs generated by an example run of
the DLIO benchmark (https://github.com/argonne-lcf/dlio\_benchmark).
In total, 24 logs were generated by independent processes in an
emulated deep learning I/O workload.

This set of logs make for convenient test cases for new PyDarshan
tools that can analyze sets of logs in one command (e.g., job\_stats
and file\_stats).
