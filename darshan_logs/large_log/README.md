This example is an anonymized version of the largest Darshan log generated
on the Theta system at the ALCF in the month of October 2021.

The log has been anonymized, converted to bzip2 compression, and is hosted
as an external download.  It can be downloaded from the link listed in the
theta-large-anonymized-example-2021-bz2.darshan.link file in this
subdirectory.  After downloading, rename the resulting file to
theta-large-anonymized-example-2021-bz2.darshan.

You can also download all such large files in this repository in bulk using
the `download-large-logs.sh` script at the top level of this repository.
